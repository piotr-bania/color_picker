# About Simple Color Picker

Simple Color Picker is a tool that resonates with emotions. Colors are not just visual elements; they carry feelings, memories, and sentiments. Every shade you see on a palette has a story, an emotion attached to it. Be it the calmness of blue, the fervor of red, or the freshness of green; every hue has its own tale.

The beauty of this color picker lies in its simplicity. You don't just select colors; you feel them. And the option to add your custom colors means you're not restricted. It's a canvas, and you're the artist. Paint your emotions, add them to the palette, and let the world see the shades of your feelings.

Built with Next.js, this tool ensures performance and reliability. But more than the technicalities, it's the emotions that drive this project. Because at the end of the day, it's not just about picking a color; it's about choosing an emotion.

Feel the colors. Experience the emotions.
